</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is not a part of the United States that does not
have its share of fascinating folklore. From the coast
of California and its legends of gold, to the hardy New
England shores, rich with its stories of shrewd Yankee
peddlers, personalities and fables march back from the
past and implant themselves into the region as firmly
and lastingly as the giant redwoods of California or the
huge elm-arches of Yarmouth on Cape Cod. An integral
part of sectionalized history, American folklore
holds its own as a meter by which we may judge and
understand those hardy men and women who took the
new world in their hands and molded its character for
the generations to come.</p>

<p>The title of this volume is perhaps misleading. Tall
Tales of Cape Cod they are, yes, but in a broader
sense that are the feel and the basis of a way of life.
These fables and superstitions, personalities and adventures
cannot be labeled merely Tall Tales, for they
were such an important part of life on Cape Cod that
to think of the narrow land without them would be impossible.</p>

<p>The stories I have presented here are, in a sense,
true. Some of them are original, that is, products of
my own imagination, fired by the Cape and its history.
Others are as old as the Cape itself, and have been repeated
time and again. Still others have been gleaned
from conversation with Cape Cod folk and from the
invaluable old books which I have been fortunate
enough to have made available to me.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me to state the credulity
of the tales found in this volume, that is a matter entirely
for the reader to decide. But this is Cape Cod,
with its adventure and romance, mystery and humour,
and I hope that the reader will find in them the true
feel of a land that is incomparable in history, salty
humour, and rock bound tradition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... No Kissing On Sunday</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It isn’t</span> unusual during the light-hearted days of
Spring, or during any season for that matter, to see a
boy and girl exchange a kiss. But back in the days
when a kiss between any but married couples was a
gross impropriety, any demonstration of affection on
the Sabbath was against the law, even between married
couples. There is no attempt to claim here that this
law was never broken, but woe unto those hapless
couples who were found out!</p>

<p>A Harwich great-great-great-ancestor, a red blooded
sailing man, had been away on a long sea journey, and
returned unexpectedly on one Sabbath afternoon. He
strode down the street to his home, and at the gate,
bellowed joyously for his wife. She rushed out the door
and into his arms, and the captain’s natural inclination
was of course to greet his wife with a hug and a kiss.
They both, in the moment of meeting, quite forgot
the law which forbade any such goings on. A prying
neighbor—a frustrated old maid, no doubt—reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the incident to the authorities, with the result
that the affectionate captain was clapped into the
stocks for two days to repent.</p>

<p>Not less than a month after this romance thwarting
incident, another couple was hauled into court. It
would seem from this story that it was not god-fearing
folks who gathered garden fresh peas on the Sabbath.
The husband had returned from the sea Sunday morning,
and his loving wife, knowing that fresh peas were
his favorite vegetable, had gone into her garden and
gathered an apron-full for dinner. It is not known what
punishment was levied on the couple, but it is recorded
in the family records that “they received their just
punishment with god-like mien.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The lights</span> in the cell block of the Charlestown
State Prison shone forth in musty yellow streaks one
mid-summer night in 1849. It was the hour when the
prisoners were left to their own devices within their
tiny cells before the final night lock-up.</p>

<p>The final lock-up bell clanged through the stone
prison, the main lever was thrown, and the block was
dark save for two lanterns at the end of the long
corridor. The men settled down to sleep. But in the
corner cell of Section 3, 2nd floor, there was no
thought of sleep. The occupant of this cell was William
Phelpes, sentenced to a long term after confessing
to a startling $50,000 bank robbery at Wheeling. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
loot had never been found, and it had taken authorities
a long time to catch up with Phelpes. But it was not
thoughts of reclaiming the fortune upon being released
from prison that kept Phelpes awake this night. He
had no intention of waiting ten long years to return
to the outside world, and tonight he was planning a
way to beat this waiting. His was not a plan of violence
or a foolhardy attempt at escape. Phelpes was not
unintelligent, and although he had little formal education,
he was nevertheless known to be shrewd, cagey,
and quick-witted.</p>

<p>Phelpes waited until the prison was completely
quiet and he could hear only the steady breathing from
the cell next to his, and an occasional murmur from
the lips of some uneasy sleeper. Then he sprang into
action. He took his tin drinking cup in his hand, and
rattled it across the bars of his cell, hollering loudly
for the guard. The lights in the corridor lit up, and the
guards came running down to his cell, where Phelpes
demanded to see the warden, saying that he wished
to tell of the whereabouts of the $50,000.</p>

<p>When the warden stumbled sleepy and red eyed
from his room, his annoyance about being awakened
was amazingly short-lived when he learned the reason.
It was decided that the search for the loot was to start
early the next morning. Phelpes had promised, under
guarantee of a lightened sentence, to lead the warden
and his assistants to the very spot in which he had
hidden the $50,000. The buried treasure, said Phelpes,
was at Cotuit on Cape Cod.</p>

<p>There were two men that did not sleep in the prison
that night, for their heads were whirling with plans.
These men were Warden Robinson and Prisoner
Phelpes. A golden cloud of money and freedom from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
the job of warden filled the mind of Warden Robinson,
for his share of the reward promised for the return
of the money would make it possible for him to
retire and live pretty much as he chose. For Phelpes,
the golden cloud meant only one thing—freedom,
and already his mercurial thoughts were sliding from
one fabulous plan to another—plans that could only
be fulfilled by this freedom.</p>

<p>At 5 o’clock the next morning, Phelpes, Warden
Robinson and the sheriff started out for Cape Cod
and the $50,000. Phelpes, after the trio had arrived
at Cotuit, and the general vicinity of the buried loot,
pulled out a map, which he had carefully prepared the
night before, and studied it intently. Elaborate steps
were taken to follow the map to the letter. Warden
Robinson’s hands shook as he held the map in his
hands, and even the calm Phelpes seemed ruffled and
excited.</p>

<p>The exact spot was finally found, and the digging
began—digging that went on and on for what seemed
like endless hours. It grew darker as evening began to
turn into night when Phelpes sprang to his feet and
shouted “We’s almost there!” Shovels tossed dirt
furiously, and the exhilarated sheriff leaped into
the hole for a closer look. The warden’s face, illuminated
by the lantern which he held, was a mask of
suppressed desire, and his eyes were holes of excitement
and longing. He had no thought of anything but
the money which lay so close within his grasp. But it
was at this moment that Phelpes, forgotten both by the
warden and the sheriff in this instant of near-wealth,
put his ingenious plan into culminating action. As the
warden leaned still closer into the hole where the
sheriff was still frantically digging Phelpes lifted his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
foot and booted the gullible warden into the hole on
top of the sheriff. In the confusion that inevitably
followed, Phelpes made a successful dash for freedom,
and later made his way to the true spot where the
$50,000 was hidden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"> &#160; &#160;... How Scargo Lake<br>
Got Its Name</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The handsome</span>, stalwart young brave runner from
a distant tribe looked just once at the proud and fiery
Princess Scargo, beautiful daughter of Sagem, chief of
the Bobusset tribe that once dwelt on the shore of
Dennis, and lost his heart to her. And the Princess,
who had given her heart to no man before, fell madly
in love.</p>

<p>As token of his love and devotion, the young brave
presented his beloved with a beautifully carved, hollowed-out
pumpkin, filled with water in which were
swimming four small silvery fish. The Princess adored
her gift, and placed the small fish in a tiny pond which
she hollowed out with her own hands. The beautiful
Indian maiden spent long hours by her pond, for her
lover had promised to return to her before the fish had
grown to maturity. And so every day she watched the
growth of her fish, for each change in size brought her
closer to the young brave to whom she had pledged
her love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>But the summer was a long and dry one, and when
Princess Scargo went to her pond one morning, she
found it dry and three of her beloved fish dead. The
Princess was mad with grief. She wept and wailed, and
the tears of grief kept alive the one remaining fish,
which she placed once more in the pumpkin.</p>

<p>Her indulgent father immediately called an important
pow-wow. It was decided that a lake should be
dug especially for Princess Scargo’s fish. The strongest
and most skillful brave shot an arrow in four directions.
Each time an arrow fell, it marked a boundary of the
lake.</p>

<p>The work of digging the lake basin went on
steadily. When Autumn’s bright hues painted the
countryside, and the Fall rains came, the lake bed
filled deep and clear.</p>

<p>Princess Scargo placed her fish in the man-made
lake, and prepared to wait once more for her lover. He
came as he had promised, and after their marriage,
they lived in their lodges on the shores of Scargo Lake,
where the descendants of the silvery fish, token of an
Indian love, still swim.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... The Curse of<br>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;Old Mother Melt</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No one</span> knew her real name, or from where she
came. She seemed as old as Time itself, and her
cavernous eyes were fathomless pits of mystic wisdom.
The villagers spoke of her in hushed tones, and they
called her Old Mother Melt. They believed she was
a witch.</p>

<p>Old Mother Melt lived in an ancient, ragged cottage
on the outskirts of Provincetown, and the townspeople
dared not venture near her cottage after dark. Many
a youth, returning from an evening of courting in a
neighboring town, and forced to pass by the cottage of
Old Mother Melt on his way home, was scared out
of his breeches by the strange noises and eerie lights
that came from the windows. This fear came from
years of inbred superstition and ignorance, for Mother
Melt had never done any harm that could be proven.
Nevertheless, she remained an avoided, fearsome
character. Whenever disaster, illness or calamity
befell someone in the village, there were many who
murmured ominously about “one of Mother Melt’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
curses,” and the threat that “Old Mother Melt will
get you” disciplined many an obstreperous child.</p>

<p>Whenever Mother Melt made one of her infrequent
trips to the village for a few meagre staples, those on
the streets slid quickly into doorways and shops,
children scampered to their calling mothers, and all
peered suspiciously at the grotesque old figure of
Mother Melt as she picked her way slowly through
the narrow streets.</p>

<p>The days of Old Mother Melt were the great days
of fishing in Provincetown, and there was not a seaman
in the village who would go near her cottage the
week before he was to sail. But there was one whaling
man, Capt. Samuel Collins, who scoffed at any mention
of such things as witchcraft and curses, and it was
to this man that Mother Melt spoke one day. Her request
was a simple one. She knew that Capt. Collins
was to leave shortly for a long whaling trip, and she
asked that he take her son, a strong, intelligent lad of
about fifteen, with him on his trip as cabin boy and
apprentice. Captain Collins had no qualms about
accepting, for he knew and liked the boy, and had
often been impressed by his quickness. So Mother
Melt’s dream of her boy off to sea, perhaps someday
becoming master of his own ship, was realized.</p>

<p>But through some mix-up, when sailing time arrived,
Mother Melt’s son was not to be found, and the
captain could wait no longer for the boy. As the Collins’
ship sailed away, Mother Melt was at the wharf
shrieking a curse upon the ship and all its hands.</p>

<p>Several weeks of steady winds and fair weather
favored Captain Collins, but this run of good weather
was shattered by a freak storm of sudden, fierce intensity.
Monstrous waves and savage winds battered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
fishing ship. Several of the crew were washed overboard
to their deaths, and valuable time was lost in
repairing the damage. Captain Collins recalled then
the curse of Mother Melt, and declared that she was
responsible for the disaster, for he could see no other
explanation for the weird freak storm which had arisen
so unexpectedly and caused so much damage. He
swore to kill Mother Melt when he returned to
home port.</p>

<p>When the great fishing ship limped into Truro,
Captain Collins wasted no time. He was the first to
stride down the gangplank and made his way straight
to the old cottage at the edge of Provincetown village.
There he found Mother Melt, weak and spent from a
long illness. But nothing halted him or his anger.
Mother Melt pleaded so passionately for her life, however,
that he gave up his determination for revenge and
promised to spare her if she in turn promised to never
again utter a curse.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Old Mother Melt, Captain
Collins took her son under his wing, and the lad
later became master of his own ship, which had a
long and remarkable record of clear sailing, free from
storms and disasters. It is said that Mother Melt
watched over the ship as it sailed the seven seas.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... Barney Gould</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I happened</span> into the Orleans General Store one drizzly
afternoon, and found some old timers gathered round
the potbellied stove, reminiscing about days gone by,
and some of the personalities that colored those days.
Perhaps the old cracker barrel, the wonderful, mixed
smell of molasses and spices, and the kerosene lanterns
were missing, but, in the midst of modern conveniences
of a modern store, I travelled back into the past
as I listened to the talk that flowed around the circle
by the stove. Rain streaked down the window panes;
a little puddle of rain water at the doorway widened
as a few stragglers came in out of the storm, stamping
their boots, and shaking off their slickers like ducks
just out of water. The moods of the weather have a
wonderful effect on conversation in such a setting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and bring forth stories almost forgotten, stories oft-repeated,
and tall tales that grew and grew with the
years.</p>

<p>Seth Finlay had a ghost of a smile on his wrinkled
face, and a reminiscent twinkle in his deep-sea eyes.
I heard him chuckle deep down inside, and felt somehow
that a good yarn or two was forthcoming. Seth
caught me looking at him, and chuckled again.
“’Spose you’re wondering what I’m lookin’ so pleased
about, don’t you? Wal, I’ll tell ye. All these stories
’bout what you off-Capers would call ‘characters’
brings to mind old Barney Gould. I ain’t sayin’ all the
stories you hear ’bout him air true, but he was quite a
feller. A mite bit tetched, mebbee, but harmless.</p>

<p>“One thing he was most set about. That was usin’
trains or enythin’ else besides the two legs that God
gave him. He uster make regular trips up Boston and
back, carryin’ packages and letters for folks. ’Twasn’t
long before we wuz callin’ him ‘Barney Gould’s
Express!’ And I swan efen one day, when Ben Howes
wanted a dozen wood-end tooth rakes, he gave Barney
a quarter and the durn fool walked all the way to
Boston, got the rakes, and hiked all the way back with
the rakes over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Nuther funny thing ’bout Barney. He’d got the
idee somewheres that he owned the roads. He’d stop
everybody he met and ask ’em for two cents for his
‘road tax.’ I ’member one day he came up to me for
the tax. All’s I had was a dime. He said that would
pay my road tax for five years. If he’d lived fer that
five years, he would’ve waited ’til then to ask me
again; he never forgot who had paid and who hadn’t,
and never hit up the same feller twice in the same year.</p>

<p>“Yu’ve heard tell about them long-distance walkers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
I calculate. Wal, Barney was one of ’em. Least aways
that’s how the stories go. They tell one story ’bout
that’s kinda hard t’ believe. Seems that Cap’n Joel
Nickerson was startin’ off in his schooner for New
Orleans. Barney was foolin’ ’round down the dock,
helpin’ the crew cast off. Cap’n Nickerson hollered
over to him—‘Say, Barney—meet us down New
Orleans to help us tie up, will ye?’ You won’t believe
me, but sure enough, when the old schooner hove ’long
side at the New Orleans dock, there was Barney,
waitin’ to help tie up. He’d walked all the way from
P’town to New Orleans.</p>

<p>“An’ one time—bet you won’t believe this either—he
thought he’d like t’ see the Wild West. Yep—walked
all the way to ’Frisco and back. Took him near
two years, but he said it was wuth it. ’Course, that was
when he was young and strong. Yep—he sure had a
pair of legs, did Barney Gould.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"> &#160; ... It Pays to Keep<br>
the Sabbath</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe Crocker</span>, down Wellfleet way, learned through
bitter experience that it pays to keep the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Joe was always one to find a dollar, and when he did,
he made the most of it. But he didn’t hanker after
what most folks call real work. His financial status
depended mostly on old Lady Luck. And she chose
one Sunday to shine down on him.</p>

<p>Joe was strolling down the beach one Sunday morning
when God-fearing folks were in church, and he
came across a school of blackfish flung up on the
beach. Now a man who finds such a school of beached
blackfish is a fortunate one indeed, for he is well
paid for the “melons” that are found in the skulls of
the fish.</p>

<p>Old Joe promptly set to work cutting his initials in
the blackfish skulls as a claim to his ownership. He
was busily engaged in this task when the Methodist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
minister came by and caught him in the act, so to
speak. He reprimanded him severely, and Joe just
laughed. The minister said he could laugh then, but
that he would get the devil’s own pay tomorrow,
and strode on. I guess he knew it was useless to try
and convert a melon-cutting heathen on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Well, early next morning, Joe went down to sell his
fish, but the market prices had taken a sudden weekend
drop, and the sperm oil man wouldn’t buy. So
there was Joe, left with a beach full of smelly blackfish.
And you’ve never smelled such a stench as comes
up from a beached school of blackfish when the wind
is coming from the sea. The townspeople finally
couldn’t stand it another minute, and a group of them
came down to the beach to get rid of the school. And
sure enough, there were Joe’s initials, carved in the
skulls where he had put them on Sunday forenoon.
Those initials J.C. were enough to convince every man
jack of them that the whole smelly job was up to one
man—the owner, and the owner was obviously Joe
Crocker. He put up quite an argument, but he finally
had to hire a half dozen fishermen to tow the blackfish
back out to sea. The Methodist minister was heard to
remark that some people had to learn the hard way
that it pays “to keep the Sabbath day.” Joe didn’t
have a thing to say, and he still didn’t come to Sunday
meetin’, but no one ever saw him looking for easy
work on the Sabbath again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... Timmy Drew and<br>
The Bull Frogs</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, it is said, there lived in Chatham
on Cape Cod a little whipper-snapper of a fellow,
named Timothy Drew. Timmy was not more than
four-feet-eight, and that standing in his thick-soled
boots. And so, as befalls so many unfortunates of
Timmy’s stature, he was forced to accept heckling
from his taller associates, among whom Timmy appeared
a dwarf. But long-legged men held no fears
for Timmy, for although small, he made up in spirit
what he lacked in bulk, as is so often the case with
small men. Timmy was all pluck and gristle, and
no steel trap was smarter.</p>

<p>When Timmy refused to stand for the gibes that
were thrown at him, he was chock full of fight. To
be sure, he could hit his tormentors no higher than the
belt-buckle, but his blows were so rapid and full of
force that he beat the daylights out of many a ten-footer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
When Timmy was in his fiery youth, the
words “If you say that ’ere again, I’ll knock you into
the middle of next week!” were enough to quell any
belligerent.</p>

<p>Timmy Drew was a natural born shoemaker. No
man around could hammer out a piece of leather with
such speed and accuracy. Timmy used his knee for
a lap stone, and years of thumping made it hard and
stiff as an iron hinge. Timmy’s shoe shop was near
a pleasant valley on the edge of a pond. In the Spring,
this pond was a fashionable gathering place for hundreds
of bull frogs, that came there from all parts to
spend the warm season. Several of these bull frogs
were of extraordinary size, and as they became used
to Timmy, who spent some time down near the pond’s
edge feeding them, they would draw near to his
shop, raise their heads, and swell out their throats
like balloons until the area vibrated with their basso
music. Timmy, keeping busily at his work to the
accompaniment of this bull frog male chorus, beat
time for them with his tooling hammer, and in this
manner the hours passed away as pleasantly as the
day is long.</p>

<p>Now Timmy was not one of those shoemakers who
stick eternally to their bench like a ball of wax. In
fact, Timmy made a habit of carrying his work to his
customer’s house, partly for assurance of perfect fit
and partly for company. Then, too, he always stopped
at the tavern on his way home from work for sociability
and to inquire about the day’s news. It was here
especially that Timmy found his size unfortunate, for
here gathered all the jokers and wags of the neighborhood,
as well as the notoriously teasing and practical
joking peddlers. Although Timmy felt as uncomfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
as a short-tailed horse in fly time in this company,
he loved to be there and reveled in the conversation
and the stories that were told.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Timmy, however, the peddlers
took the keenest delight in imposing on his credulity
as well as on his stature. They always seemed to have
the most amazing conglomeration of tall stories at
hand, but also seemed to have even more amazing
ones when the gullible Timmy was present. They had
learned long before that Timmy was not to be toyed
with about his height, but still retained their practice
of goading him on to believe their incredibly tall tales.
And there was no one who can describe an incredible
fact with more plausibility than a peddler. His profession
alone had taught him to maintain an iron
gravity when selling his wares, which, with very few
exceptions, could certainly not sell themselves. Thus
their tales, sufficient in themselves to embarrass any
other narrator, carried great conviction.</p>

<p>But there was a joke which the peddlers played on
Timmy that carried itself out far beyond any and all
expectations. Many and diverse were the pranks
played on Timmy the gullible, but never before one
with such repercussions as this one, which, from the
start, seemed made to order for him.</p>

<p>A fashionable tailor in the neighboring and larger
village decided to advertise in Chatham, thereby
bringing to himself trade from the small community
and others like it. This tailor took it on himself to have
a large and flaming advertisement made which was
posted in the tavern which Timmy frequented on his
way home from the shoe shop. The advertisement
excited general interest, for the tailor asserted to have,
at greatly reduced prices, a splendid assortment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
coats, pantaloons and waistcoats of all colors and
fashions, as well as a great variety of trimmings such
as tape, thread, buckram, ribbons, and—this last
item was especially stressed—“frogs,” those cord
material hooks in the shape of that deep-throated and
squat reptile.</p>

<p>The next time Timmy appeared at the tavern, his
associates and peddler hecklers pointed out to him the
advertisement, with special stress on the “frogs.” They
reminded him of the plenteous supply of these frogs
to be found in his own neighboring Lily Pond.</p>

<p>“Why, Timmy,” they said, “this is the chance of
a life time. If you were to give up shoemaking and
take to frog catching, you would make your tarnal
fortune!”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked Timmy.</p>

<p>“Why, lad,” spoke up one of the peddlers, “can’t
you see by that poster that frogs are in great demand
in fashionable tailoring?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Timmy,” spoke up still another conspirator
in the joke, “you might bag a thousand in half a day,
and folks say they will bring a dollar a thousand!”</p>

<p>It was obvious that these words had a great effect
on Timmy, for he was carefully considering the suggestion,
and could see the money pouring already into
his outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“There’s frogs enough in Lily Pond,” he mused,
“but it’s tarnation hard work to catch ’em. I swaggers!
They’re plaguey slippery fellows!”</p>

<p>Then up spoke Joe Gawky, by far the most infamous
practical jokester in the company. “Never mind,
Timmy. Take a fish net and scoop ’em up. You must
have ’em alive, and fresh.” And then, drawing Timmy
aside, Joe whispered, “Tell you what I’ll do. I’ll go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
you shares. Say nothing of it to anyone. Tomorrow
night I’ll come up and help you catch a goodly batch,
and we’ll divide the gain.”</p>

<p>Timmy was in raptures. But he was, as you will
soon see, counting his frogs before they were caught.</p>

<p>As Timmy walked home that night, a cagy thought,
upon which he inwardly prided himself, came into his
head. Thought Timmy, “These ’ere frogs in a manner
belong to me, since my shop stands near Lily Pond.
Why should I make two bites at a cherry and divide
profits with Joe Gawky? By gravy! I’ll get up early
in the morning, and be off with a batch of them to
the tailor’s before sunrise, and so keep the money all
to myself!”</p>

<p>And so he did. Never before had there been such
a stir among the placid frogs of Lily Pond. In fact,
they were taken quite by surprise, and with no little
difficulty. Timmy captured a huge bag of them and
set off on his journey to the tailor’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckram, the fashionable tailor, was an elderly
gentleman, and a nervous one, and, when disturbed,
inclined to be peevish. Mr. Buckram was also very
particular both about his own attire and that of his
customers, and prided himself on the neat-as-a-pin
appearance of his shop.</p>

<p>The unsuspecting Mr. Buckram was busily engaged
in making a waistcoat for a Harwich gentleman when
Timmy entered the shop. The sight of Timmy alone
was enough to make anyone take notice, but Timmy,
together with a large and curiously jumping bag slung
over his shoulder was indeed a sight to see. Timmy
wasted no time in preliminaries, perhaps under the
impression that big business needed no introduction.
Since the tailor had not noticed or seemingly did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
hear his entrance into the quiet shop, Timmy assumed
that the elderly man was deaf. So, without further
ado, Timmy leaned down, and, pressing his mouth
near the old man’s head, bellowed at the top of his
lungs, “Do you want any frogs today?”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i022.jpg" alt="Pg 22"></div>

<p>The old gentleman dropped his shears and jumped
clear off his stool in astonishment, viewing Timmy
with a mixture of amazement and alarm. “Eh? Any
frogs? What in tarnation for?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a fine lot here,” persisted Timmy, thinking
the tailor was being shrewd. “They are jest from
the pond, and lively as grasshoppers!”</p>

<p>Mr. Buckram was plainly confused. “Don’t bellow
in my ears,” he exclaimed. “I’m not deaf! Tell me
what you want and then be off.”</p>

<p>“I want to sell you these frogs. You shall have them
at a bargain. Only one dollar a hundred. I won’t
take a cent less. Do you want them or not? If I can’t
get satisfaction here, I shall go elsewhere, and you
shall miss out on a great bargain!”</p>

<p>Mr. Buckram thought he was face to face with a
miniature mad man, and attempted to rid himself of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the small nuisance with bravado. “No, I don’t want
any frogs. Now get out of my shop, you young fool!”</p>

<p>“I say you do want ’em!” shouted Timmy, “but
you’re playing offish-like to beat down my price. I
won’t take a cent less, I tell you!”</p>

<p>The conversation went on like this for fully ten
minutes, and finally Timmy, puzzled, mortified, and
angry, slowly withdrew. “He won’t buy ’em,” thought
Timmy “for what they are worth. And as for taking
nothing for them, I won’t. And yet, I don’t want to
lug them back to Lily Pond again. Curse the old man
anyway. I’ll try him once more, and be durned if I’ll
ever plague myself this way again!”</p>

<p>And once more he entered the tailor shop.</p>

<p>“Mr. Buckram, this is absolutely your last chance.
Are you willing to give me anything for these frogs?”</p>

<p>The old man was goaded beyond endurance. He
sprang from his work and took after Timmy with his
long shears.</p>

<p>“Well, then” said Timmy bitterly, as he backed
away, “Take ’em among ye for nothing,” and so saying,
emptied the contents of the bag on the floor of
the shop and marched indignantly away.</p>

<p>Well, you can imagine the confusion that followed.
One hundred live bull frogs had a marvelous time
jumping about the shop. Every nook and corner had
a bull frog in it, and to make matters worse and add
to the confusion, they set up a loud and indignant
cacophony of chug-a-lums.</p>

<p>And thus dissolved the golden visions of Timmy
the Frog Catcher.</p>

<p>After this affair, Timmy could not bear the thought,
sight, sound, or mention of a frog. He never admitted
that a joke had been played on him, but his associates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
would not let him forget the incident. They referred
constantly to the matter. He was rarely seen now at
the tavern, and even the town children called after
him on the street—“There goes the frog catcher.”
You see the story had spread up and down the Cape,
and Timmy had no peace.</p>

<p>The sound of frogs singing in the Lily Pond incensed
Timmy to such a degree that he would run out
of the shop and pelt the poor things with stones to
stop their noise. It seemed after a while that their
song, which he heard both day and night, had
definite words in it, and contained his own name.</p>

<p>On one night in particular, Timmy was awakened
from sound sleep by a tremendous bellowing directly
under his window. It seemed as if all the frogs in the
world were clearing their throats for a mass chug-a-lum.
He listened with amazement, and could soon
distinguish—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Boooooooo</div>
<div class="verse">Timmy Drew-o-o-o</div>
<div class="verse">I can make a shoe-o-o-o</div>
<div class="verse">As well as you-o-o-o</div>
<div class="verse">And better too-o-o-o</div>
<div class="verse">Timmy Drew-o-o-o</div>
<div class="verse">Boooooooo</div>
</div></div>

<p>Timmy was certain no ordinary frogs could pipe out
such a song at that rate. He leaped out of bed and
rushed from the house. “I’ll teach those rascals to
come around plaguing me,” he said. But no one could
be seen. It was a clear bright night, all was solitary
and still, save for an occasional rumble from the sleeping
frogs. After throwing a few stones into the bushes,
Timmy retired once more and fell into uneasy sleep.</p>

<p>The amazing concert continued night after night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
swelling on the evening breeze, and then sinking away
into the distance. Again and again Timmy attempted
to discover who were the perpetrators of the nightly
serenading. They could not be found. He began to
feel certain that he was to be forever haunted by the
music. His friends sympathized with him, but Timmy
was too upset to sense the mischief in the air.</p>

<p>The next time Timmy stopped at the tavern, he
found all in earnest consultation.</p>

<p>“Here he comes,” said one, as soon as Timmy
entered.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the news?” inquired the tavern
keeper.</p>

<p>“No,” said Timmy with a groan.</p>

<p>“Joe Gawky ’as seen sech a critter in the pond! A
monstrous large frog, as big as an ox, with eyes as
large as a horse. I never heard of no such thing in all
my born days!”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Sam Greening.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Josh Whiting.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Tom Bizbee.</p>

<p>“I have heard tell of sech a critter in Ohio,” said
Eb Crawley. “Frogs have been seed there, as big as
a suckling pig, but not in these ’ere parts.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Timmings,” said Sam Greening, “feels quite
melancholy about it. She guesses as how it’s a sign of
some terrible thing that’s going to happen.”</p>

<p>“I was fishing for pickerel,” said Joe Gawky, who,
by the way, was a tall, spindle-shanked fellow, with a
white head, and who stooped in the chest like a crook-necked
squash. “I was after pickerel, and had a frog’s
leg for bait. There was a tarnation big pickerel just
springing at the line, when out sailed this great he-devil
from under the bank. By the living hokey! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
was as large as a small-sized man! Such a straddle-bug
I never seed! I up line, and cleared out like a blue
fish, I can tell you!”</p>

<p>Timmy searched anxiously the faces of all present
for some sign of spoofing, but he could see only sober
concern that credited the story. He began to feel very
uneasy.</p>

<p>“That must be the critter I heard t’other night in
the pond!” exclaimed Josh Whiting. “I swanny, he
roared louder than a bull.”</p>

<p>This last statement aroused in Timmy divers emotions,
all connected with the serenading that had been
his for the past many nights. In vain, the company
questioned him concerning his knowledge of the matter.
He would not say a word.</p>

<p>After this introduction, the conversation took naturally
to discussion of the supernatural. Each one had
some story to tell of witches, ghosts and goblins. By
degrees, the company dispersed, until Timmy Drew
found himself quite alone. He found it difficult to
get up and start home, for the conversation had impressed
him more than he would admit at the time,
and the walk home by the Lily Pond was nothing he
cared to consider.</p>

<p>At length, he got up courage and started home. His
course lay over a solitary road, darkened by over-shadowing
trees. A tomb-like silence, heightened by
his thoughts, prevailed, disturbed only by his echoing
foot-steps. Timmy Drew marched straight ahead with
a stealthy pace, not daring to look behind, yet dreading
to proceed by Lily Pond. At last he reached the top
of the hill at the foot of which were his house and
Lily Pond. He had just about reached his door, when
a sudden rustle of leaves by the pond brought his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
heart dry and bitter to his mouth. At this moment, the
moon slipped aside a cloud and seemed to focus on
an object that turned Timmy to stone on the spot.
An unearthly monster, in the shape of a mammoth
bull frog, sat on its ugly haunches, glaring at him with
eyes like burning coals. With a single leap, it was by
Timmy’s side, and he felt one of his ankles caught in
a cold wet grasp. Terror gave him strength. With a
howl and a Herculean effort, he pulled himself away
from the monster’s clutches and tore up the hill.</p>

<p>“By the living hokey!” said Joe Gawky, slowly rising
from the ground and arranging his clothing. “Who’d
uv guessed thet this ’ere old pumpkin head atop my
shoulder with a candle a-burning in it would have
set old Timmy’s stiff knees a-goin’ at that rate! I
couldn’t see him travel for the dust his boots rose!”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that Cape Cod saw no
more of the Frog Catcher from Chatham, Timothy
Drew.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... The Wrong Gulls</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cap’n Caleb Nickerson</span> of Truro, master of a large
ship which oftentimes took on young boys as apprentices
and cabin boys, was sailing home to the Cape
after a long journey. When the ship was almost to
P’town, Cap’n Nick, bone-weary and worn from the
long run, decided to turn the wheel over to young
David, a youth who had shipped out with him to
learn the fine art of seamanship.</p>

<p>“But, Cap’n Nickerson,” the boy demurred, “I
don’t know much about navigation yet, and the compass
is still strange to me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Lad,” said Caleb reassuringly. “See
them gulls over there? Wal, just folly them right
along, and they’ll take ye right home to port.”</p>

<p>With these words, Cap’n Nickerson went below to
his quarters for a snooze. When he awoke a few hours
later, he peered out of the porthole and was dumfounded
to find himself still out in the open ocean,
when the ship should have arrived in Provincetown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
long before. Rushing madly topside, the cap’n
grabbed poor Dave by the nape of the neck, and in
a few choice mariner’s words, demanded what in
tarnation he thought he was doing.</p>

<p>“But, Cap’n,” exclaimed the perplexed boy, “you
told me to folly them gulls over there, and I’ve been
right on their trail!”</p>

<p>Cap’n Nick grabbed the telescope, took one squint-eyed
look at the gulls, and then bellowed, “Why you
durn fool! Them’s Chatham gulls, not Truro gulls!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Cape Cod</span> widow, whose married life had been far
from peaceful and happy, refused to let the minister
write a flowery tribute for her husband’s gravestone,
as was the custom.</p>

<p>But propriety and convention of the times insisted
that something appear carved on the headstone, and
so the indomitable woman left the choice of verse
entirely up to the local stone-cutter. He resorted to
the stock phrase:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“As I am now, so you will be—</div>
<div class="verse">Prepare for death and follow me.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Convention thus being satisfied, no more was
thought of the matter, but when friends and relatives
paid their next visit to the grave, they were
shocked and stunned to see, carved beneath the stone-cutter’s
verse, these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<h2 class="nobreak"> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ... The Singular Case of the<br>
Young Anatomist</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fate</span>, that capricious ruler of the tides that governs
our lives, arranged a meeting on the wild, windswept
Hill of Storms in Truro on Cape Cod; a meeting so
strange that, for the sake of credulity, I must withhold
the name of the earthly being who took part in it. For
it was on a dark Fall night, long ago, that a Cape
Cod boy, with nothing in his pockets but his dreams
and a burning ambition, met and talked with a live
skeleton, and, caught up on the crest of Fate’s precarious
wave, was swept high to Fame and Fortune.</p>

<p>We will call him Tom, and nothing else, this young
and ardent hero of our story, for if, in the telling of
this strange tale, which I swear to be true, the real
name of the young man were disclosed, you, gentle
reader, would scoff and read no further.</p>

<p>A look at young Tom as this amazing story unfolds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
would reveal a singularly insignificant youth, dreamy
of eye and slight of form. Tom burned with that white
flame of ambition thwarted by a financial standing
about equal to that of a beachcomber, and a scanty
country education. But youth has strange ways of
overcoming such obstacles, and Tom’s energies, rather
than diminishing, seemed to gather momentum and
strength from the meagre stuff upon which they were
fed. Why or how, cut off as he was from higher learning,
Tom chose Anatomy as his field to conquer, no
one knows, but chose it he did. He spent every waking
hour and every dream yearning for the day when he
would be able to buy for himself the text books that
would pave his rocky road to Success. A penny here,
and, a week later, a penny there—finally Tom was
able to purchase a small text on Anatomy. In less
than three weeks, he had memorized, with the correct
Latin names thrown in for good measure, every
word, every definition, every diagram in the text book.
This subject was his life, and he wrapped himself
so completely in his fierce desires that to shake hands
with a man became not merely a gesture of friendship,
but a good chance to feel the finger bones manipulate.
But, happily, Tom was too intelligent not to know that
this knowledge, although he could describe exactly the
position, use, and articulation of every bone in the human
body, did not make him an anatomist. For his
descriptions were merely a repetition of the words in
the small book which had become his bible. His burning
desires now changed course to those of seeing and
examining an actual skeleton, and these thoughts
buzzed around in his mind like a swarm of angry bees.</p>

<p>A pensive, solitary figure, Tom sat one night by the
huge fireplace in the local Inn, lost in thought and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
dream. The flames in the fire before him took the shape
of grinning, cavorting skeletons. He was so absorbed
in his dream-world that the noisy animation and
conversation about him pricked his consciousness no
harder than a fly on an elephant’s hide. The men
were talking, as they had for weeks, about old Cyrus
Goodestone, a man always thought of as rich, but who
had died without a trace of money to be found anywhere,
much to the distress of his creditors.</p>

<p>But when, during one of those violent and sudden
early Spring rain storms, the door of the Inn flew
open, and a hooded and cloaked stranger strode into
the room, even Tom took notice. For the stranger
stood before the fire, his back to the company, and
neither spoke nor turned when greeted. The storm
stopped as suddenly as it had started, and when the
moonlight shone once more through the window, the
stranger heeled about, gathered his voluminous cloak
more closely about him, and left. An eeler, sitting near
Tom, spoke up:</p>

<p>“That be a queer chap. I’m a-goin’ to see what he’s
about,” and with these words, he too left the Inn.</p>

<p>Less than five minutes later, he returned, white as
a flounder’s belly. He made a beeline for the table,
and gulped down a glass of rum. Then, gasping, partly
from fright and partly from the raw drink of rum,
he spoke.</p>

<p>“Udds hiddikins! Old chap just gone out—got
no proper face like—only a Death’s head—looked
me square in the face in the moonlight, he did, and
I c’n tell ye, I waited to see no more!”</p>

<p>At this startling tale, Tom sprang from his lethargy
like a man possessed, and clutching the terrified eeler
by the coat lapels, he yelled, “You mean—he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
skeleton?” When the answer was a startled “yes,”
Tom shouted, “Which way did he go?”</p>

<p>“Why, down towards the graveyard, sure,” said
the eeler. But Tom was out the door before the words
had barely tickled the lips of the eeler.</p>

<p>No thought that the eeler might have been “seein’
things” entered Tom’s mind and he tore down the
road toward the graveyard on Truro’s Hill of Storms.
The wild wind, the scudding clouds that made the
night a night of shadows, the bony-fingered branches
that picked at his face as he ran through the shortcut
in the woods—of these things Tom was unaware.
For on the Hill of Storms, midst gravestones battered
by sea winds and spray, was his heart’s desire!</p>

<p>Tom stood at the top of the hill, bracing himself
against the sea wind. His heart thudded against his
ribs like the heavy breakers that boomed against the
rocks below. His wild eyes swept the graveyard, and
then, in the split second when the clouds parted, and
the moon shone through, Tom saw, still enveloped
in the cloak, the figure from the Inn, gazing sorrowfully
down at the new grave marker of Cyrus Goodestone.
Then, in a sudden sweep of wind, the cloak
billowed up, fell to the ground—and left, gleaming
phosphorously in the misty moonlight, the unbelievable
figure of a Skeleton!</p>

<p>“Thank my stars!” yelled Tom. “I have found my
Skeleton at last!”</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the Skeleton in a hollow voice,
clacking his hideous hinged jaws, “Attend!”</p>

<p>“How beautifully,” cried Tom, ignoring the command,
“can I see the play of the lower maxilliary!”</p>

<p>“Attend, I say!” repeated the Skeleton, in a still
more frightening voice. And then, turning, “Rash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
boy, what are you about?” exclaimed the bony apparition.
The fact is, our enthralled hero was busily running
his fingers up and down the vertebrae of the
Skeleton, counting them to see if they corresponded
with the number given in his book, and muttering
gleefully, “Seven cervical, twelve dorsal—just right!”</p>

<p>The Skeleton, angered and shocked speechless,
raised his arm and shook his fist at the absorbed
Tom, who, with his eyes fixed on the bony elbow,
merely shouted joyfully, “The gingyloid movement
is perfect!”</p>

<p>The Skeleton was plainly confused. Never before
had he, accustomed to scaring the wits out of people,
encountered any such attitude as this, for Tom stood
before him completely unafraid. He was amazed at
the scientific stand taken by our young anatomist. As
a matter of fact, the skeleton began to feel a little wary
himself, and moved away from Tom, darting in and
out from behind the gravestones in an effort to get
away. But Tom was not to be put off at this late date,
and overtaking the Skeleton, grabbed on and held for
all he was worth.</p>

<p>The ensuing conversation, however, was friendly,
and the Skeleton explained that he was old Cyrus
Goodestone himself. He had, he said, buried his
money underground, and could not rest in peace until
he had dug it up and paid off his creditors. This he
asked Tom to do. Tom consented, upon one condition,
which he laid in a very businesslike manner
before the Skeleton.</p>

<p>“It will be some trouble,” he said, “and the affair
is none of mine, but look ye—I’m willing to comply
with your request, if, as a reward, you will allow me
to come here and study you every night for the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
month. You may then retire to rest for as long a time
as you please.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” cried the Skeleton, and, recovering from
his original alarm, shook hands with the exultant Tom
to seal this strange bargain.</p>

<p>Tom found the money, just as the Skeleton had
said, distributed it among the amazed creditors of
Cyrus Goodestone, and passed every night for the
next month in the graveyard on the Hill of Storms.
There, amidst the gravestones, he studied his accommodating
Skeleton, who, as it turned out, was a congenial
and humorous fellow. The Skeleton tirelessly
moved into any position or pose Tom requested,
giving the young anatomist an opportunity no other
had ever, or will ever have, that of watching the actual
bone movement of a live Skeleton!</p>

<p>By the end of the month, Tom and his Skeleton
were warm friends, for they had discussed many
things, and had played cribbage by the grave of Cyrus
Goodestone, upon many occasions when the night’s
posing was done. They parted with regrets, and the
Skeleton wished Tom success and happiness in his
career.</p>

<p>Tom completely retained in his mind all he had
observed in his amazing month’s study, and by that
knowledge, laid the foundation of a profound anatomical
science by which he was afterwards to become
famous.</p>

<p>It is needless to state that the above is the early
history of an obscure Cape Cod boy with a dream who
became a famous anatomist, and that any and all other
accounts are baseless fabrications.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;... The Mooncussers of<br>
Cape Cod</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Remaining</span> only in tradition as some of the most
colorful characters in the unending novel of Cape Cod
are the swashbuckling domestic pirates known politely
as salvagers, romantically as mooncussers, and more
authentically as bandits.</p>

<p>Fables and tradition say that a band of these men
anciently infested the shores of Cape Cod. But they
were not merely plunderers who swept down on unsuspecting
victims; their business was a serious, planned
and profitable one, flavored with a touch of the wildly
romantic stuff of which pirate stories are made. Theirs
was a dangerous game, and they played it well.</p>

<p>The whole band of them were mounted on horses
when they began their nightly adventures. Up and
down the beaches they rode, armed with large lanterns
which they placed at strategically dangerous points
along the shores. These decoy lanterns led ships astray
on treacherous sandbars and shoals. This completed,
they plundered them of everything, leaving the ships
stripped and gutted.</p>

<p>A group of the mooncussers would divide, two of
them tramping the beach in one direction, two in the
other, a shingle held up to protect their eyes from the
flying sand, and straining to pierce the darkness for a
light from a ship in distress or for a glimpse of a hull
on the bars off shore. Perhaps the first sign would be
a spar flung up by the wild surf, the tattered remnants
of a sail, or the still and battered form of a dead sailor.
It is easy to see the origin of the word “mooncusser,”
for moonlight nights held no profit for these men, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the beauty of moonlight on still ocean was cursed and
not admired.</p>

<p>The nights of the mooncussers were the nights of
howling winds, thundering surf, and a wild and turbulent
sea, for those were the nights when the work
of the mooncussers were the most profitable. It was
a wild setting for a wild play.</p>

<p>But the advent of the huge lighthouses, put up after
much opposition, especially from the men of Eastham,
put an end to mooncussing, for the great white eye of
the light beacon could pierce the darkness of a night
even brighter than the hated full moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many, many moons, the great tribe of the Mattacheesits
had lived in peace in their lodges near the
clear blue waters of Cummaquid. It was a noble
tribe, renowned for its beautiful young maidens, its
fearless braves, and especially for its Great War
Sachem, the Giant Manshope. But the heartbreaking
mourning of the death dirge had many times wailed
through the camp, for the Mattacheesits had a foe
far more terrible than any fierce enemy tribe.</p>

<p>Twice each year since the beginning of Time—once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
in the Moon of Bright Nights, and again in the Moon
of Falling Leaves—the Great Devil Bird from over
the Southern Sea spread wide his smothering wings
and swept down on the tribe, capturing in his terrible
talons the little papooses, and even some of the youngest
braves who had just learned the art of the tomahawk.
With a laughing shriek, he bore them away to
his secret lair in the Region of the South Wind, where
no man had ever ventured. They were never seen
again.</p>

<p>On the eve of a triumphant victory over the Nausets,
Great War Sachem Manshope returned, leading
his braves in the ritual chant-dance of victory. But
the battlecry was mingled with the wail of the death
dirge, floating up towards the braves from the camp,
and echoing sorrowfully through the stillness of the
summer evening. The Giant Manshope found his
faithful squaw with face gashed and breast torn, the
ashes heaped on her head mingling with tears of
anguish, for the Great Devil Bird had carried away
her first-born, a strong young brave of just sixteen
summers. The Devil Bird had carried him off to the
Unknown Place before the sun had dropped from
the edge of the world.</p>

<p>A fierce cry, filled with all the venom and hate and
sorrow of many moons and many deaths, tore from the
throat of Manshope. His people trembled with fear
and pride as they watched him stand there, his face
aglow with the call of battle, his eyes savage with hate
and revenge, for they knew that their great leader
would leave for the Unknown Place, stalking the Great
Devil Bird.</p>

<p>His huge war tomahawk in his hand, Manshope
strode away without a word from the camp, the wails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of the sorrowing squaws and the war shrieks of the
braves echoing in his ears. The war drums beat their
relentless rhythm of death for the Devil Bird. With
giant strides that took him across the breadth of the
Cape, Manshope plunged thigh deep through the
deepest streams, pushed trees aside in forests he had
no time to skirt, and came at length to the low
treacherous swamplands that lay at the edge of the
Southern Sea, the last barrier to the Unknown Place.
In the misty half-light, Manshope saw, far in the distance,
the Great Devil Bird, its human prey in its
talons, winging its way swiftly towards its lair.</p>

<p>Many wondered, but none knew what lay in the
Unknown Place across the Southern Sea, for no man
had dared cross the churning waters to that island lair
of the Devil Bird. But the Sachem’s eyes saw the
turbulent waters not as danger, but as a bloody challenge.
The Giant Manshope called out to the Great
Spirit to give him the strength and cunning to follow
the Devil Bird to its hiding place and slay him there.
Then he strode boldly forth into the deep, treacherous
waters.</p>

<p>Guided only by the stars, he came at length to the
strange and feared Unknown Place, now Martha’s
Vineyard. From the western end of the island, he
saw majestically sheer cliffs which rose straight from
the sea. At the narrowest end of the land, he saw
something which made his heart sink, and his blood
run cold in his veins, for there was a giant oak, its
twisted exposed roots strewn with the white bleached
bones of Indian children captured by the Devil Bird
for countless years.</p>

<p>The Giant Manshope crept noiselessly towards the
death tree. Under the enveloping shadows of its great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
branches he looked up, and saw the dim silhouette of
the Devil Bird sleeping in the uppermost branches.
Its head was beneath its wing, its beak dripped blood,
and its belly was distended with gluttonous human
feasting.</p>

<p>Manshope glanced at the stone tomahawk in his
hand, and saw it gleam in the half-light. He fastened
it to his belt, and then swung himself soundlessly up
through the branches towards the sleeping Devil Bird.
At last he reached his goal at the top of the Death
Tree, so close to the Bird that the night breeze ruffled
its feathers across Manshope’s cheek.</p>

<p>There he paused, gazing down at the Bird, hate in
his eyes, his heart beating wildly with the excitement
of near victory and revenge. He raised his weapon
high over his head and brought it down with a crushing
thud on the neck of the Devil Bird. The Great
Evil One fell to earth, never to rise again.</p>

<p>Panting with excitement and triumph, Manshope
waited until he was sure the Devil Bird was dead
before he left the hated Death Tree and its sorrowful
remains. But his triumph had a bitter taste, and his
heart was heavy, for although he had vanquished the
Great Evil One, his soul cried out in anguish for his
beloved son.</p>

<p>Lost in sorrowful meditation, Manshope rested for
a while at the northern end of the island before
returning to his camp on the mainland. He drew forth
his pipe, but the tobacco was dampened by the waters
through which he had plunged, and would not burn,
so he gathered some poke weed, and, loading his
pipe, sat quietly smoking. As he smoked, the rings
and swirls from his pipe billowed and rose through the
early morning air. It floated across the Southern Sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
over the Cape moors and the lodges of the Indian
camp, where his sorrowing squaw awaited his return.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing in the Indian lodges when
Manshope’s people saw this smoke, for they knew
that their Great Sachem would never linger to smoke
his pipe while an enemy he was stalking was still alive.</p>

<p>The Great Devil Bird no longer ravaged and killed,
and the Indians lived without fear once more. And
when the sweet summer air drifted in from the woods,
the mist lay low on the swamplands, and the fog bank
from the sound curled in over the mainland just as the
smoke from Giant Manshope’s pipe did on that
morning—Indian mothers drew their children closer
to the fire, and while the enveloping mists and fogs
crept slowly in, they told them the legend of the
Great Devil Bird, saying, “Here comes Old Manshope’s
Smoke.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter nights are long on Cape Cod. When the
lonely winds howled ’round the house, and the naked
branches tap-tapped against the windowpane, friends
and neighbors gathered in the big, warm kitchen of
the old Nickerson farmhouse down Rock Harbor
Road in Orleans for an evening of story telling and
popcorn or apple roasting.</p>

<p>Jonathan Snow, twelve years old, full of imagination
and very impressionable, loved these story evenings.
Jonathan would curl up in his favorite niche
between the fireplace and the window, and there,
munching on apples, would listen pop-eyed to the
spooky stories. Here he was close enough to the
bright, friendly fireplace to feel secure, but also close
enough to the dark eye of the window and the wild,
windy night to feel a delicious tingle of fear run up
and down his spine.</p>

<p>One bleak and howling February night, when the
stories had been especially hair-raising, a lull in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
conversation and a few yawns proclaimed that it was
time for all to depart for their respective homes.
Jonathan knew he should leave, but he felt chained
to the fireside. He couldn’t stay, was too proud to
voice his fears, and yet shuddered at the thought of
leaving this warm kitchen for the dark and lonely
walk home. But boy’s pride won. Jonathan buttoned
up his greatcoat, pulled his wool cap down over his
ears, and bidding the Nickersons a brave but reluctant
good night, set off for home.</p>

<p>It was not far from the Nickerson to the Snow
home, but the night was a wild one; a night of wind
and floating mist, when familiar daylight objects assumed
fantastic shapes, and the road was filled with
shadowy forms. Jonathan held himself in admirable
check for about 100 yards. He strolled along whistling
casually, but when he glanced back and could see
no more the winking lights of the Nickerson house,
he was casual no longer, and tore at breakneck speed
down the road.</p>

<p>Rounding the turn that meant the halfway mark to
home, in the place where the road was flanked on one
side by a high stone wall and on the other by a creek
which ran parallel to it, Jonathan stood stock still,
blood turning to slow ice in his veins. For there, not
four yards before him, gleaming in a flickering pool
of moonlight that filtered through the scudding
clouds, was a coffin.</p>

<p>Three thoughts scampered through the terrified
Jonathan’s mind. He could jump the stone wall,
splash through the creek, or leap over the coffin and
make a dash for home and safety. And jump he did.
Now a twelve-year-old Cape Cod boy can jump like
a grasshopper, but Jonathan did not jump high enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Just as he thought he had cleared the coffin, and indeed,
his feet were running before they touched the
ground, his ankle was clutched by a bony hand, and
he was pulled right into the terrible coffin!</p>

<p>Reflex action and young strength bounded together
simultaneously. Using all his energy, Jonathan pushed
out with his hands and heels and leaped from the
coffin like fat from a hot skillet. Scared near out of his
wits, Jonathan broke an all-time speed record to home.
There he babbled out his story to puzzled parents,
who, as hardy Cape Codders, scoffed at the idea of a
coffin, but decided to go and investigate anyway. So
Jonathan, armed with mother and father, returned to
the fateful spot, only to find that the “coffin” was a
two-bushel market basket which had rolled from a
peddler’s cart, and which, in the dark night, Jonathan’s
aroused imagination had turned into an occupied
coffin. The resident of the coffin, which Jonathan
believed had clutched his ankle, was only the high
basket handle which he did not clear in his leap
for life.</p>

New York</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It all</span> started when a seventy-ton whale washed
ashore at Wellfleet. Now, seventy tons of whale is
no easy thing to deal with, and the costs of towing the
whale back out to sea were more than the town fathers
felt the thin town treasury purse could afford. Many
suggestions were offered, but two enterprising old sea
captains hit on a plan to raise enough money for the
project with perhaps money left over to add to the
town funds.</p>

<p>Why not charge admission to see the whale? This
seemed like an excellent scheme but the Board of
Health had something to say about having a dead
whale on the docks that squelched the plan before it
got into motion. But the old seamen, undaunted, still
thought it was a good plan.</p>

<p>Yankee ingenuity reached an all-time high when the
captains decided to find out for themselves just how
many people would pay fifty cents for the dubious privilege
of seeing a seventy-ton dead whale. They decided
to tow the monster to New York, paying all towing
charges, which were by no means slight, themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Their fellow townsmen scoffed at the idea, but the two
captains answered that the whole project would undoubtedly
reap a goodly financial harvest, and that the
town could whistle for a part of the expected profits.
But, sad to relate, the get-rich-quick scheme back-fired,
for the two down-Capers found that the New York
Board of Health was no more eager to have a month’s
dead whale reposing in smelly grandeur on their docks
than were the Wellfleet officials. And so the two captains,
poorer but wiser, and by this time sick and tired
of the whole business, dug deep into their pockets once
more and made suitable arrangements for the disposal
of the whale. When they returned home and were met
with a cross-fire of questions, they had not a thing to
say.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... The Snake Biting Indian</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tall, straight</span>, and dark browed, Joseph Naughaught
was a familiar figure as he made his way
throughout the Cape, Bible tucked under his arm.
Wherever his wandering feet brought him, he stopped
to preach for Christianity, for he was a converted Indian.
Pious, rum-hating Joseph was a self-made man
both educationally and religiously, and was well known
as a religiously, and at times, fanatically, sincere man—so
well known for this, in fact, that he soon came to
be called “The Deacon.”</p>

<p>When “The Deacon” was not evangelicaling, converting,
or leading future converts in prayer, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
be found, in all seasons, strolling leisurely through the
woods and along the beaches.</p>

<p>One bright Fall day, when the Deacon was walking
through the Truro Hills, he came to his favorite place
of meditation, a rocky, cave-like shelter which was
close to the ocean bluffs. There he sat for some time,
quietly smoking and thinking, when his thoughts were
arrested by a strange and ominous hissing.</p>

<p>The Deacon was trapped, for there directly before
the mouth of the cave, was a huge circle of deadly
black snakes. The Deacon was unarmed, and the
snakes he knew, would close in on him faster than
light at his slightest movement. He sat frozen with
horror.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged by. The Deacon never took
his eyes off the snakes, and they in turn were like
frozen black ribbons, heads slightly raised, as they
stared at him with eyes he could not see. The small
gusts of occasional sea breeze were cold against the
Deacon’s skin, for he was drenched with the sweat
of fear.</p>

<p>The snakes crawled slowly towards him, with one
of the black lines a little ahead of the others. When
the reptiles reached his feet, they stopped once more.
He could hear their soft hissing, and feel the weight
of the lead snake across his foot. They moved again,
like a soft, clinging wave, slithering and undulating
towards him. Sluggishly and relentlessly they moved
up his immobile form, until they had twined their
dank bodies all around him. They clung to him like
tenacious pieces of damp wool. The Deacon could
see their wicked slit eyes, bright and expressionless,
but deadly; he could hear their hissing breaths, and
feel their hungry bodies in a horrid caress. Still he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
did not move a hair, a muscle—he seemed not
to breathe. The leader snake was wound around his
neck, and was looking, his head raised, right at the
Deacon, darting its flat head in and out at the Indian’s
face.</p>

<p>On one of these thrusts, when the snake’s head
came within an inch of his mouth, the Deacon opened
wide his great jaws, and at the moment when the snake
thrust its head inquiringly inside, the Deacon clamped
shut his huge teeth, and bit the snake’s head off. This
so frightened the rest of the snakes that they hurtled
themselves from the Deacon’s body and fled. Some
of the black reptiles were stunned from their fall, and
the Deacon, master of the field, quickly killed them
with a huge stone. The dead snakes he skinned, and
brought their dried hides home as evidence of the
terrible encounter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... Johnny Blunt’s Courtship</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After the</span> sleigh ride last winter and the slippery
tricks served by Patty Bean, nobody would suspect
Johnny Blunt hankering after women again in a hurry.
To hear him rave and take on, and rail out against
the whole feminine gender, you would have taken it
for granted that he would never look at one again, to
all eternity.</p>

<p>Johnny did take an oath and swore if he ever
meddled, or had any dealings with women again—in
the sparking line, he meant—he might be hung or
choked. But swearing off women, and then going
into a meeting house chock full of gals, all shining and
glistening in their Sunday clothes and clean faces, is
like swearing off liquor and going into a grog shop—it’s
all smoke.</p>

<p>Johnny held out pretty well for three whole Sundays
but on the fourth there were strong symptoms of a
change. A chap looking very much like Johnny, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
seen on his way to the meeting house, with a new
patent hat on, his head hung by the ears upon a shirt-collar,
his cravat had a pudding in it, and branched
out in front into a double-bow-knot. He carried a
straight back, and a stiff neck, as a man ought to when
he has his best clothes on, and every time he spit, he
sprung his body forward like a jack-in-the-box, in order
to shoot clear of the ruffles.</p>

<p>Squire Jones’ pew was next but two to Johnny’s and
when Johnny stood up he naturally looked straight at
Sally Jones.</p>

<p>Now Sally had a face not to be grinned at in a fog.
She was easy to look at and Johnny succumbed.</p>

<p>Squire Jones had got his evening fire on and set
himself to read the great Bible, when he heard a rap
at his door.</p>

<p>“Walk in. Well John, howder do? Git out Pompey!”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, I thank you Squire; and how do you
do?”</p>

<p>“Why, so as to be crawling. Ye ugly beast, will ye
hold yer yop! Haul up a chair and sit down, John.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mrs. Jones?”</p>

<p>“Oh, middlin’. How’s yer marm?”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the mat there Mr. Blunt.”</p>

<p>This put Johnny in mind that he had been off
soundings several times in the long muddy lane, and
that his boots were in a sweet pickle.</p>

<p>It was now old Captain Jones’ turn, the grandfather.
Being roused from a doze by the bustle and rattle, he
opened both his eyes, at first with wonder and astonishment.
At last, he began to halloo so loud that you
could hear him a mile, for he took it for granted that
everybody is just as exactly deaf as he is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Who is it, I say? Who in the world is it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones going close to his ear, screamed out, “It’s
Johnny Blunt!”</p>

<p>“Ho, Johnny Blunt! I remember he was one summer
at the siege of Boston.”</p>

<p>“No, no, father; bless your heart, that was his grandfather,
that’s been dead and gone this twenty years!”</p>

<p>“Ho! But where does he come from?”</p>

<p>“Daown taown.”</p>

<p>“Ho! And what does he foller for a livin’?”</p>

<p>And he did not stop asking questions after this sort,
till all the particulars of the Blunt family were published
and proclaimed by Mrs. Jones’ screech. Then
he sunk back into his doze again.</p>

<p>The dog stretched himself before one andiron, the
cat squat down before the other. Silence came on by
degrees, like a calm snowstorm, till nothing was heard
but a cricket under the hearth, keeping time with a
sappy yellow birch forestick. Sally sat up prim as if
she were pinned to the chairback, her hands crossed
genteelly upon her lap, and her eyes looking straight
into the fire.</p>

<p>For Johnny’s part he sat looking very much like a
fool. The more he tried to say something, the more
his tongue stuck fast. He put his right leg over his
left, and said “Hem!” Then he changed, and put the
left over the right. It was no use, the silence kept
coming thicker and thicker. Drops of sweat began to
crawl all over him. He got his eye upon his hat,
hanging on a peg by the door, and then he eyed the
door. At this moment, the old Captain all at once
sung out:</p>

<p>“Johnny Blunt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>It sounded like a clap of thunder and Johnny started
right up on end.</p>

<p>“Johnny Blunt, you’ll never handle sich a drumstick
as your father did, if you live to the age of Methuselah.
He would toss up drumsticks, and while it was wheelin’
in the air, turn twice around, and then ketch it
as it come down, without losin’ a stroke in the tune.
What d’ye think of that, ha? But scull your chair
round close alongside er me, so you can hear. Now
what have you come arter?”</p>

<p>“I arter? Oh, jist takin’ a walk. Pleasant walkin’.
I guess I mean, jist to see how ye all do.”</p>

<p>“Ho, that’s another lie! You’ve come a courtin,
Johnny Blunt, and you’re a’ter our Sal. Say, now, do
you want to marry, or only to court?”</p>

<p>This was a choker. Poor Sally made but one jump,
and landed in the middle of the kitchen; and then she
skulked in the dark corner, till the old man, after
laughing himself breathless, was put to bed.</p>

<p>Then came apples and cider, and the ice being
broke, plenty of chat with Mammy Jones about the
minister and the “sarmon.”</p>

<p>At last, Mrs. Jones lighted t’other candle, and after
charging Sally to look well to the fire, she led the way
to bed, and the Squire gathered up his shoes and
stockings and followed.</p>

<p>Sally and Johnny were left sitting a good yard apart.
For fear of getting tongue-tied again, Johnny set right
in with a steady stream of talk. He told her all the
particulars about the weather that was past, and also
made some pretty ’cute guesses at what it was like to
be in the future. Johnny gave a gentle hitch to his
chair until finally he planted himself fast by Sally’s
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“I swow, Sally, you looked so plaguy handsome
today, that I wanted to eat you up!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Get along with you,” said she.</p>

<p>Johnny’s hand had crept along, somehow, upon its
fingers, and began to scrape acquaintance with hers.
She sent it home with a desperate jerk. Try it again—no
better luck.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Jones, you’re gettin’ upstroperlous; a
little old maidish, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Hands off is fair play, Mr. Blunt.”</p>

<p>Johnny finally managed not only to get hold of
Sally’s hand but managed to slip his arm around her
waist. But not satisfied with this he began to go poking
out his lips for a kiss. But he rued it for Sally fetched
him a slap in the face, that made him see stars, and
set his ears to ringing like a brass kettle, for a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>“Ah, Sally, give me a kiss, and ha’ done with it,
now?”</p>

<p>“I won’t, so there, nor tech to—”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it whether or no.”</p>

<p>“Do it, if you dare!”</p>

<p>How a bus will crack of a still, frosty night! Mrs.
Jones was about halfway between asleep and awake.</p>

<p>“There goes my yeast bottle,” says she to herself,
“Burst into twenty hundred pieces; and my bread is
all dough again.”</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter is that Johnny fell in
love with Sally Jones, head over ears. Every Sunday
night, rain or shine, finds him rapping at Squire Jones’
door; and twenty times has he been within a hair’s
breadth of popping the question. But now Johnny has
made a final resolve. If he lives till next Sunday night,
and doesn’t get choked in the trial, Sally Jones will
hear thunder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery Smith</span> of Chathamport was thrilled and
impressed when John Atwood, a respected widower,
asked her to be his second wife. Nevertheless, being
slightly younger than Widower Atwood, Margery demurred
for quite some time before consenting to be
his wife. Before she finally said yes, the widower
carried on an extensive courtship and it was said that
his promise of building a new house for his bride finally
convinced her in his favour.</p>

<p>The trusting maiden waited until the knot had been
tied before raising the question of the promised new
house, only to be met with John’s reply of “Oh, that
was jest courtin’ talk, Margy.” But although he shattered
love’s young dream in that respect, he did build
a small addition on to the old house. Margy spent the
rest of her life in that hot ell of a kitchen, and never
became mistress of a new house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... Shipwrecked</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> yellowed, tissue-thin paper, bound in leather, and
entitled simply “Journal,” was found an entry which
matches all the adventure stories of shipwrecked men
ever told. Its authenticity can only be judged by the
excerpt which follows:</p>

<p>Herein the reader, if there be any, will find the story
of my most harrowing experience at sea. It is only by
the Grace of God Almighty that I am alive this day
to record it thus.</p>

<p>I was twenty years old when I shipped out from
Boston on a journey to the East Indies. She was a
good ship, my fellow crew members were capable,
congenial men, many of whom I had sailed with in
the past. Our captain had earned our respect even in
the few short days we had been acquainted with him.
All hands and officers were convinced that clear sailing
and a profitable journey lay before all.</p>

<p>I cannot record here in a vivid enough manner, my
impressions during the first three weeks of our sailing.
The weather was fair and mild, good winds had prevailed
constantly; the life aboard ship was especially
pleasant. There was no need for any such feeling as I
had found myself indulging in for several days. But
it nevertheless prevailed. Perhaps all I can coherently
say is that I had a vague unrest, a mind-plaguing
thought constantly with me, like the shadow of some
dark cloud over my being. This feeling brought with
it the still, subconscious impression of disaster and
imminent death which I could not, try as I would,
shake off. I said nothing to my mates about this
feeling. They would perhaps have scoffed at me—if
not, my revealing of such an impression would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
serve to disturb the uncommonly smooth-running life
of our close existence on the lonely seas.</p>

<p>It was on a calm, uneventful afternoon, while all
hands were engaged in dilatory activities of repair and
small duties, that this feeling reached its highest peak.
I felt a strange compulsion to plunge into immediate
intense activity, for my fears were mounting by the
minute, and, in my youthful mind, I felt vaguely
ashamed. I had just left my post by the starboard
boat, where I had been engaged in lashing down some
canvassing, when I glanced up to see the lookout in
the crow’s nest peering intently out to sea. I knew
somehow that my fear was about to materialize. And
verily, a moment later, the call came from the nest,
“Ship on far port horizon ho! She bears the Jolly
Roger!”</p>

<p>The action over our entire ship was so instant in
contrast to the almost sluggish movements of the
minute before that it was as if a painting had suddenly
sprung into life, each of its immobile figures leaping
into definite motion. We clapped on every sail, but
the pirate ship was on us before we could get up
enough sail to escape. They sent a shot straight
through our rigging.</p>

<p>The happenings of the next hour remain in my
mind only as a confused jumble of shouts, clashing
swords, and hand to hand combat. The pirate crew
were a determined and bloodthirsty lot, not content
to merely take over our monetary possessions. They
outnumbered us and overpowered us, deliberately
destroying and ravaging everything upon which they
could lay their hands.</p>

<p>They seemed at last content with what damage they
had wrought. The burly pirate captain ordered us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
abandon our ship, which he and his men then set afire.
Before the fire had reached the hold, what few of our
number were left managed to reach some supplies, and
with those few essentials, we rowed away. I will never
forget the frustrated agony in my soul as I watched
our valiant ship, strewn with the bodies of our gallant
captain and mates, burn to a charred skeleton, and
sink slowly beneath the waters....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i062.jpg" alt="Pg 62"></div>

<p>There were two lifeboats, lost and tiny as pea pods
on a pond, drifting in lone aimlessness on the sea.
There were eight of us, including myself, in one boat,
and five in the other. We saw the other boat, which
we could not reach because of the waves, drift farther
and farther away. At last, after it had been hidden
from our sight by a monstrous wave, we saw it again,
capsized. We tried valiantly to reach those who were
floundering in the sea. It was hopeless. One by one
they sank beneath the surface, lost forever in the
smothering embrace of the sea.</p>

<p>For a day and a night, the fierce winds and huge
waves crashed against our small craft, and I cannot
explain today why we did not meet the same fate as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
had our unfortunate comrades in the other boat.
Upon the second day, the rolling sea was changed to
a flat, millpond surface, and the sun was unbearably
hot. We had managed to bring with us only four
bottles of water, enough to last but a few days. We
did not live, we merely existed. I felt the gnawing,
piercing pangs of thirst and hunger congest and constrict
my being. Within fourteen days, four of our
number had died of thirst, and there were three men
besides myself left, starving.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="Pg 63"></div>

<p>My hands, when I reached up to touch my burned,
bearded face, were trembling like a man beset with
palsy. My eyes, I knew, were like my comrades’,
empty, vacant, hopeless. I was conscious only of a
searing ache over my entirety, and my mind was skipping
and sliding over disjointed thoughts. We looked
at each other, and still did not see; we were conscious
only of hunger and heat and thirst. When we spoke,
it was as if in a dream. Jackson had managed to hook
a small fish, but had not the strength to pull it into
the boat. I believe we realized the helplessness of our
plight, and began at that moment of realization to get
crazed. It was not long before we began to talk of
drawing lots to see which of us should be killed to
provide food for the others. The thought is horrible
and distasteful now, as I sit with my belly full of good
warm food, but then the thought meant only one
thing—the lessening of the most terrible of pains—Hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>We resisted this impulse as long as humanly possible.
But at last the time came when we must destroy
one of our number, or fall upon each other like crazed
wolves. We cast lots, and it fell upon me to be the
victim. I prepared to die so that others might live.</p>

<p>I cannot give my reader any searing recollection of
faith or impression that come to a man about to die,
for I had none. I knew only that my breast was bared,
and that one of my mates, with arm raised, was about
to plunge his knife into my vitals. I believe that I
wanted to die. But the shining knife did not come
sweeping down, for at that moment, we heard a gunshot
in the distance, and, looking in the direction from
which the sound came, saw a white sail on the horizon.</p>

<p>This ship had seen our distress signal—my own shirt
which hung from a propped up oar—and had fired a
shot to let us know we had been seen. Death, under
such horrible circumstances, breathes hotly down on
few men.</p>

<p>I lived to see the pirate captain who had been the
cause of our agony hanged from his own yardarm in
the harbor of Calcutta.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early days of Eastham, when the menfolk were
concerned with the business of the sea, there lived a
Captain Jed Knowles and his young, lovely, and devoted
bride. The captain was a fine figure of a man.
Mrs. Knowles, for all her beauty and sweet womanliness,
was strange indeed, for they said that she had
strange supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Knowles was devoted to her sailing husband,
and, as did many of old time Cape wives, sailed with
him on several of his voyages. When love was young,
and absence unbearable, Captain Knowles liked to
have his wife along with him, but the objections of
the crew, who, according to the best sea superstition,
believed that a woman aboard was bad luck, soon
added to his misgivings about taking her along. Besides,
time was not kind to the temper of Mrs.
Knowles, and she soon became not a pleasure to have
along, but rather a bother. The captain soon decided
that such companion voyages must cease.</p>

<p>For several voyages now, Captain Knowles, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
great opposition and argument from his good wife, had
succeeded in sailing without her.</p>

<p>On one occasion, however, when the captain was
to leave for an extensive voyage, his wife once more
requested that she be allowed to accompany him. The
answer was a firm negative, and much to the captain’s
surprise and delight, Mrs. Knowles did not demur, and
offered no argument to his decision. And this quick
change about fooled the unsuspecting seaman, for he
underestimated the power of a woman, especially the
strange power of his own wife.</p>

<p>On the day of departure, Mrs. Knowles bade her
husband a fond goodbye at the door of their home.
The captain went down to the docks, weighed anchor,
and was on his way. He did not know, however, that
a tiny mouse had followed him aboard close at his
heels.</p>

<p>Three days out at sea, the captain got a report from
the cook that cheese and other like supplies were
being nibbled upon by what was certainly a mouse.
The captain, who prided himself on a clean and
rodent-free ship, directed him to set poison for the
scavenger, and thought no more of the matter.</p>

<p>But the captain did not rest easy. His sleep was disturbed
upon many occasions by a rustling, scampering
noise in his cabin. When he arose and lit his lamp, he
was stunned to see, sitting on the foot of his bunk, a
tiny mouse, seemingly unafraid and serene, looking
straight at him. This happened night after night, and
the captain became quite fond of the little creature.
But when upon one occasion, he found that the mouse
had eaten up a midnight supper, and gnawed upon
his log book, as well as starting to scamper up and
down the bed while the captain was asleep, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
changed his mind. Taking up his whip, he struck the
little mouse with it, killing it, and tossed it out of
his porthole.</p>

<p>When the captain returned home, he opened the
door to find his wife dead on the floor in a pool of sea
water with the mark of a whiplash across her face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... Ole Bill Hardy</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal’late</span> I never seed the likes of Ole Bill Hardy.
Yep—he was a humdinger alrite. Thar were a heap of
shrewd peddlers ’round about in my day, young feller,
and b’lieve me, they were the cagiest bunch of fellers
y’ ever see. Y’ had ter watch yer step when y’ were
bargainin’ withum, yesseree sir, else ye’d find yerself
holdin’ the shy end of the stick. But the feller that
uster drive the sharpest dickers was Ole Bill Hardy.
’Twa’nt many wimmin, or men folks either, ’round
here that hadn’t been spliced at one time or nuther
by Ole Bill.</p>

<p>I ’member one time in partic’lar—happened right
here in the village, it did. ’Twas quite a spell ago,
when you were no more than a twinkle in the divil’s
eye. Wal, seems the folks ’round here were gittin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
some purty high flyin’ idees. Th’ town had a hearse—and
a durn good one too—that’d bin used for buryin’s
for near thuty years. And some uv these folks begun
t’ think that mebbee the old mariah ’twa’nt quite
toney enuff for ’em, so they sashayed over to town
meetin’ and voted to buy a new one.</p>

<p>One day Ole Bill was a’ drivin’ by the old hearse
house. Fust S’lectman Bijah Gibbs was loafin’ round
the doorway and spied Bill a’comin’. Thought he’d see
ifen he could get Ole Bill’s goat. He hollered out,
“Say thar, Bill, what’ll y’ give us fer the old hearse?”
But Bill didn’t bite. He jest looked Bijah rite in th’
eye and said, “Wal, I dunno. Don’t seem rightly that
yer ought ter sell the mariah. Some folks in town
ain’t even had a chanct ter ride in it yit. But if ye be
of a mind ter sell it, dunnor ifen I might give five
dollars fer it.” And sure nuff, Bill bought the old
hearse, hitched it onter hind end of his wagon and
druv off.</p>

<p>He wuz drivin’ along, proud as yer please, when he
passed Miz Tizra Small. Miz Small was alus collectin’
and buyin’ old stuff—antiques, she called ’em. Ole
Bill pulled up near her and hollers, “Here’s nuther
antique for ye, Miz Small.” Miz Small didn’t think
much of the hearse hitched onto the hind end of his
wagon. She wuz mad as a wet hen. “Shet up, you
old fool,” she says, and sallied off down the street.
Bill jest kinda chuckled.</p>

<p>Wal the next thing y’ know, Ole Bill was using the
old hearse for a peddler cart, and the women folk
were so scandalized they got up a meetin’ to complain
about it. Seems they thought it kinda improper that
the hearse thetud carried their mothers and fathers to
the grave was bein’ used to cart old brooms and tinware.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
So they raised twenty-five dollars and bought
it back from Ole Bill. He didn’t care a mite. He’d
made twenty dollars. The old hearse was put back in
the hearse house, and stayed there ’til it rotted apart.</p>

<p>’Member nuther time too. Evryone knew Ole Bill
would sell anythin’. One day he was drivin’ along
and met two young scalawags who thought they’d
have a bit o’ fun with him. They up an’ asked him
what he’d take for the pants he was wearin’. “Two
dollars,” says Bill, ’thout winkin’ an eyelash. And
durned if he didn’t peel ’em right off and hand ’em
over to the two young fellers, who were kinda taken
back, I can tell ye. “Geeyap,” says Bill, and off he
druv down the road, all wrapped up in an ole hoss
blanket.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> a good deed done on the spur of the moment
by a well-meaning philanthropist can do more
harm than good, and lead to exceedingly comical and
unexpected complications. For instance, take the case
of Squire Nickerson of Orleans, who never knew the
repercussions that resulted from a spontaneous act of
kindliness to two strangers.</p>

<p>First of all, let me introduce the principals in this
little drama: Squire Nickerson, well-to-do, prominent,
kindly; a school marm from Boston whom we shall call
Sophie, spinster, acid tongued, parched, and taken
to drinking lemon juice, which probably accounted for
her parchment-like appearance; and Seth, prominent,
well-liked and friendly as the Squire, but in very different
circles. To be blunt, Seth was an amiable old
reprobate. Good people, all of them, but when they
were thrown together, they were stirred around in the
darndest stew you ever heard of.</p>

<p>Squire Nickerson was driving, one night long enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
ago so we can spare embarrassment to those involved,
back from a business meeting in Hyannis. The road
from Hyannis to Orleans on the backside route is, and
was then, winding and dark. Squire Nickerson was dozing
in the back of his carriage when he was bumped
from his seat by its sudden stop. Looking around, he
saw that he was halted not at his home, but in the dip
bend of the road by Pleasant Bay.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong Silas?” he asked his driver.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied Silas puzzledly, “There seems to
be someone lying smack in the middle of the road!”</p>

<p>Upon examination, the someone proved to be a
rather battered elderly gentleman of indeterminate
age, and this gentleman was sound, dead, absolutely
asleep in the middle of the road. With a few suspicious
sniffs, the Squire and Silas determined with
surprise that the man was in a state not of intoxication,
but of unusual fatigue.</p>

<p>“Pick him up, Si, and put him in the carriage.”</p>

<p>“But Sir—”</p>

<p>“In the carriage, Si. We can leave him at the Inn,
poor fellow. It’s a damp night, and surely in this state
he can do us no harm.”</p>

<p>And so the unsuspecting somnambulist was transported
from the road to a fine carriage.</p>

<p>The Squire’s carriage, with its new occupant, had
not rolled down the road more than a few paces, when
it stopped again.</p>

<p>“I say, Sir. This ’eres a thing!” said Silas. “There
’pears to be a lady, sir, at the side of the road!”</p>

<p>“A lady? At the side of the road? Walking—why,
no, she’s asleep, too!” cried the Squire, peering out of
the carriage window. “Why this poor old couple!
Probably didn’t have the coppers to pay for carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
to their destination, meant to camp out tonight, and
were separated in the fog! We’ll bring both these poor
souls to the Inn.” And so they did.</p>

<p>Squire Nickerson made suitable arrangements for
food and lodging at the Inn. The old gentleman and
lady were put to bed in a fine room, and orders left
by the Squire to give them a good breakfast. Leaving
extra money with the innkeeper for the two sleepers,
and brimming over with self-satisfaction of a good
deed well done, Squire Nickerson drove to his home,
leaving his newly acquired but unconscious friends
snoring peacefully side by side, and never dreaming
that there was a possibility that he had joined a pair
whom convention and law had not made one.</p>

<p>The fact was, the old man and the old woman were
perfect strangers to one another, and their being found
in similar situations was purely coincidental. Seth,
who by now you know was the old gentleman in question,
was very accustomed to spending the night wherever
he might be, and Sophie, the lady in the picture,
traveling by stage from Boston, had become annoyed
and frightened at the antics of a rather tipply driver,
and under the impression that it was but a few short
miles to Orleans, had left the stage and started to walk.
When found by the Squire, she had just stopped at the
side of the road to rest, and had fallen into a deep and
sound sleep.</p>

<p>And so passed the night. The newly united pair
snored and wheezed peacefully beside one another until
the early sunlight broke into the room to disclose
the shocking and amazing situation. Sophie was the
first to awake, stirred from sleep by a sound she had
never heard before—that of a man snoring.</p>

<p>Imagine the consternation of the proper spinster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
when she awoke to find herself side by side in a strange
bed with a man! Where she was, or how she got there,
she didn’t know. It was clear that she was in bed with
a man, and that was an event that had never happened
to her before, and undoubtedly never would. She let
out a scream that would wake the dead. Old Seth
mumbled in his sleep, opened one eye, and then sat
bolt upright in bed, staring at Sophie, who, cowering
at the bed post, with purple face and tight shut eyes,
screamed with the continuous wail of a fire siren. First
shock turned to dumb amazement. Sophie stopped
her caterwauling and turned her head toward Seth,
who by now fully awake, sat frozen with apprehension.
She sat bolt upright on one side of the bed, he on the
other and, with eyes riveted on one another, and there
they sat, transfixed with amazement and shock.</p>

<p>“Madame,” began Seth, remembering his manners
even in a situation such as this one, “My name is—”</p>

<p>“Make me an honest woman, you wretch!” cried
Sophie, interrupting Seth loudly. It had at last struck
her that this was some monster of a man who had succeeded
in some horrible design upon her honor.
“Make me an honest woman, villain that you are, or
I will be the death of you!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, attracted by Sophie’s first screams, the
other occupants of the Inn were peeping in at the door
where they saw this amazing scene:</p>

<p>An elderly lady, keeping up a continuous stream of
gesticulations, vindictive assertions and loud pleas for
aid, was busily dressing herself more suitably for a
meeting with a stranger. And in bed, cowering and
trembling, and attempting to interject the lady’s
hollers, an old man valiantly denied any knowledge of
what had occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The Innkeeper at last interfered with the authority
of his station. On inquiry, it was found that no breach
had been made that could not be easily repaired.
Even when told the true story, Sophie would not keep
still. The old gentleman, Seth, was then asked if he
had any objections to taking his fair bedfellow for a
helpmate during the remainder of this life. What else
could he do? He stammered out his consent as well as
he could, the enraged virgin smoothed down her anger
and ruffled feathers, since satisfaction had been made
to her injured honor. The bargain was made, a gay
but strained pre-nuptial breakfast was held at the Inn,
and the happy pair were bundled off to church, amidst
the laughing shouts of the strange bridal party and uninvited
guests. There the parson waited to make good
a match too precipitously formed by the charitable
Squire who never knew the outcome of his good deed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... The Orleans Lamplighter</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At Rock Harbor</span> lived the old lamplighter of
Orleans, Josh Northrup, who took the job when the
good ladies of the church—The Sewing Circle and
Female Samaritan Society—organized the Orleans
Street Lighting Club.</p>

<p>For years Josh was a familiar figure, making his
rounds up and down the streets with his ladder, oil,
and matches. Josh listened with a philosophical nod
to all the complaints of the townsfolk, and was often
heard to sigh:</p>

<p>“I’d start on one end of my beat quite a while before
dark and folks around there would get all set up by
the spectacle of me burning oil before sundown. By
the time I reached the other end, it was after dark,
and durned if the fools down that end didn’t kick
cuz they weren’t getting their money’s worth.”</p>

<p>The lamplighter’s set of rules decreed that the lights
were not to be lit on what the calendar called a “moonlight
night” whether the moon could be seen or not.
Thus the most dangerous time to be strolling along
the streets was apt to be on a scheduled moonlight
night, for Josh always stuck religiously to the calendar.</p>

 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;Longnook Valley</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Truro</span> is on that part of the narrow land that sweeps
inward at the crook of the Cape’s long arm to form
Provincetown. Here where the scrub pines grow
tough and scrawny, and the Truro Hills roll from
backside to bayside tangled with a mesh-work of clinging
bayberry, wild blueberry, sturdy beach plum, and
coarse hog cranberry, is Long Nook Valley, a deep
hewn wedge carved in the rugged face of the lower
Cape ... a valley that stretches from the broad
waters of the Atlantic on one side of Cape Cod to
the deep half-moon waters of Cape Cod Bay on the
other. Straight through the Truro Hills goes Long
Nook Valley. The ancient sun shines down on a place
as old as Time, a place primitive, wild, and strangely
beautiful. From the deep floor of the valley, the hills
rise to the sky, silhouetted with the bony-fingered
scrub pines. In this time-scarred gouge through the
hills, legends could well have started, and superstition
and folklore have their ancient origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>The formation of Long Nook Valley is a legend
itself and concerns Meloof, a giant legendary figure
who lived in the Cape region even before the great
glacier came down from the north to chew deep paths
in the surface of the earth ... when this earth was
filled with mysterious mists and vapours, rising from a
land and sea still in a state of flux and yet unformed.</p>

<p>With arms as long and mammoth as the towering
elms of Yarmouth, and legs packed with resilient
strength of the mast of a great schooner, with a chest
as huge and powerful as the ancient Hercules, Meloof
was no mortal man. His voice could bring the wild
rains down from the skies, his whisper could churn
the waters of the sea into white foam. Meloof could
stand in the deepest waters of Cape Cod Bay, and by
stretching out his arms, touch with one fingertip what
is now Provincetown, and with the other, what is
now Orleans.</p>

<p>When Meloof got into his fishing craft, the waters
all along the Cape shores rose as if in swift high tide.
This boat was immense, its sides thick and massive,
its length enough to hold even the giant’s tremendously
long legs, gargantuan frame, and seven league
boots. Out in the wide, free expanse of the Atlantic,
in the mist and haze, went Meloof for a day of fishing.
Where the hot sun shot through the steams and
vapours, Meloof dropped anchor. He lay back in his
boat, holding in his great hands his fish pole, made
from the top of a 200 foot pine tree. These huge trees
grew in great profusion at one time over the Cape,
until a tidal wave came and stripped the lower Cape
of every living thing, leaving in its wake the dwarfed,
grotesquely scrawny pine trees now found there. Meloof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
lolled about on the waters, dreaming giant dreams,
his line slack in his hands.</p>

<p>Meloof was shaken from his lethargy! The fishing
line was a lashing whip in his hands! The pole bent
and arched into the water like the tautly drawn bow
of an Indian. It quivered and trembled. It snapped
up and down. It swished to and fro in the air.
Meloof’s shoulders were wrenched with the sudden
pull at the line, and his boat was nearly capsized
by the tremendous snap of the line—suddenly, he
knew what lay at the end! The giant, the prize of
the deep waters that Meloof had time and again
stalked and hunted, but without success.</p>

<p>In one swift movement, Meloof uncoiled his huge
frame and sprang to his feet, bracing them hard
against the sides of the boat. His nostrils dilated,
and his eyes were wild and eager with the anticipation
of a battle with an adversary worthy of his own size
and strength. Meloof’s muscles bulged like the sides
of a water cask. Blue rope veins throbbed in his
temples. Sweat poured down his massive back, and
the cords in his huge powerful wrists and hands stood
out like hawser lines. With a great bellow, Meloof
threw back his head and braced himself more firmly
against the furious strain of the battle.</p>

<p>As abruptly as it had started, the tight drawn tension
of the line slackened. Then, in another instant,
the line sprang taut and alive when the creature at
the end of Meloof’s line propelled itself out of the
water and into the air several hundred feet. A giant
codfish, with scales as large and thick as oversize barn
shingles, eyes as big and bulging as washtubs, and a
gaping slash of mouth as wide as a cave, twisted and
turned in the air. A frenzied monster of the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
waters, the giant cod thrashed about in an effort to
escape.</p>

<p>Back and forth raced the giant cod. Blue calm
waters churned white and angry. Breakers house-high
piled up on the shores. The whiplash of the line
through the water, the rushing of the boat back and
forth, made mountainous waves and whipped the
wind to gale force. The cod broke surface, and then
sounded the depths again. Then up-up- into the air
until Meloof’s line was almost perpendicular to the
water. No rearing stallion of the gods and his deity
rider had such a battle. The victory would go to the
wiliest strategist, and this the cod seemed to sense,
for, with its eyes red with fear and anger, its fins
quivering with the strain of battle, it leapt into the
air once more, and then plunged into the water,
sounding bottom. There it pivoted about and headed
straight for land. The water foamed white from the
speed of the cod’s course, and, behind him, fanned
out in an arc as it was cleaved by the bow of Meloof’s
boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i080.jpg" alt="Pg 80"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>The bullet-like course which sped Meloof and his
craft straight towards shore was perhaps more terrible
than the actual battle in the ocean. The shore loomed
bigger ahead of him, but still Meloof held fast. His
tremendous strength was sapped from the strain of the
battle, but he still had a giant’s determination to conquer.
With a last surge of strength, the cod ceased its
twisting, turning, gyrations and plowed through the
shallow waters of the shore, up and over the beach,
and straight into the Hills of Truro, dragging Meloof
and his boat behind him!</p>

<p>Rocks and boulder formations cracked and split,
hurled up and aside like pebbles. The sky was dark
with flying particles of sand and earth. Right across
the Cape from Atlantic to Bay furrowed the frenzied
cod and its tenacious captor, plowing and ripping a
deep scar through the hills!</p>

<p>And thus was formed Long Nook Valley in Truro
on Cape Cod. Traces of the giant cod are found even
today in the form of fish scales as large as barn shingles.
Some say that these fish scales are really pieces of mica,
left by the great glacier movement down from the
north, but Cape Codders know better. They are the
petrified scales of the legendary giant cod that hauled
Meloof and his boat straight across the Cape through
the hills of Truro, forming Long Nook Valley.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">... Cupid and the<br>
 &#160; &#160;Tree Warden</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A portly</span> Cape Codder, while in the midst of his
political campaign for the position of local tree warden,
strolled one evening into a tavern in search of
relaxation and rest from his campaigning. Nodding
affably to the various customers, he noticed among
those present a man who was obviously there for a
long and festive evening. This brought to mind the
intriguing thought that the lady with whom the convivial
gentleman was then “keeping company” would
probably be at home alone and in a mood to welcome
visitors. Our hero, not one to let such a promising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
opportunity pass him by, made a snap decision and
hied himself off to the lady’s house. So Cupid smiled,
but, in the offing, trouble brewed.</p>

<p>The other gentleman observed the approach and
quick retreat of the political Lothario, became suspicious,
and he too left the tavern, only a scant half
hour after the departure of his rival. Both male pride
and indignation were aroused when he arrived at the
lady’s home, for there he found the aspiring town
official clad only in his underwear, which even on
Cape Cod is not considered correct attire for a social
visit.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i083.jpg" alt="Pg 83"></div>

<p>Stunned by this disregard of convention, the lady’s
rather beery protector seized the visitor by the neck
and seat of his union suit, and hove him in the direction
of the front door.</p>

<p>Now no man likes to walk down Main Street in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
underwear on a sharp January night. The tree warden
candidate was no exception. He did not depart
meekly. He did in fact, give forceful and valiant
opposition to the attack of his enraged and indignant
adversary. It was quite a battle, and caused a riotous
commotion and an alarming collapse of furniture.
After a mighty tussle, the defender of the weaker sex
and convention found himself the victor, and the
politician found himself out on his ear—and in his
underwear—in the cold night.</p>

<p>But at this moment of victory, the local constabulary
forces, who had been called by the lady in question,
arrived on the scene. As the minion of the law
marched away with the wildly gesticulating and indignant
attacker, the underwear-clad politician, who
was brushing twigs and snow off his union suit, called
out, “Hi boys! Don’t forget I’m running for tree
warden!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span><span class="smcap">It</span> was long ago, when I was young and adventurous,
and on one of my first important sailings, that this
amazing thing occurred. We were bound for the Indies,
and while rounding Cape Horn, ran full into a
swift and violent storm that was unexplainable. For
one moment, the waters were as calmly blue as those
of Scargo Lake in Dennis on a clear summer day, and
the next, they were scowling, angry, and black. The
sky shook its fist at our ship and sent down to us such
winds and fierce rains as I have never seen before. All
about us was billowing, unpenetrable gray, and all
hands felt the atmosphere alive with some strange
force. Our navigation equipment seemed frozen, and
our rudder was cracked by the mountainous waves that
crashed against our ship. We lived in darkness, and
floundered around in that sea of gray for five terrible
days. At the end of the fifth day, a calm, a stillness
came, as suddenly as the attacking storm, and this
silence seemed the more terrible because of its contrast
with the wild gray days through which we had
just passed.</p>

<p>All hands came above, and though none spoke a
word, I knew that a strange fear gripped the heart of
each of my shipmates. I am not a poet or a man of
letters, and my words, however carefully written here,
could not adequately describe the scene which met
our eyes.</p>

<p>We found ourselves floating in the midst of a
strange, dead sea from which we could not escape. I
thought at first that it might be Sargaso Sea, for the
waters were filled with weird strands of sea plant life,
with roots as big as boulders, but common sense and
knowledge of the map made that impossible. The
sea on which we drifted was a sea of powerful currents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
each eddying in opposite directions. The water, so
clear we could see the smooth white bottom 50 fathoms
below, was a curious turquoise, streaked with
brightest greens and pinks. All around us were the
listing, vacant skeletons of ships that had found their
unexplainable way here before us. Monstrous fish,
and fish no larger than a hair, swam through the waters.
These fish were gold, green, blue, and red;
striped, streaked, and dotted with the most amazing
panorama of colors. Strange hued birds with weird
calls flew overhead, and over all this amazing scene
there was an intense, stifling silence.</p>

<p>We drifted about under the hand of the changing
currents for six weeks, and lived from the waters
around us. Some of the sea vegetation, when pulled
up, proved to be clean and sweetly edible, and the
strange, bright colored fish were easily caught. During
this period, although we were well fed, and temporarily
safe, we grew restless, and conflictions sprang up at
every turn. For however well fed and kept a man may
be, the fear of the unknown, and a wondering about
when he will see familiar land and beloved faces, keeps
him forever unhappy and discontent. Moreover, we
were all consumed with the most intense curiosity
about our strange surroundings. And always in our
minds and before our eyes were the bare hulks of the
other ships, caught in the sea, which we all hoped
would not prove to be prophetic to us.</p>

<p>We had, at the end of our six weeks of drifting,
sunk so low in our spirits, and become so apathetic
about our situation, that we became lax in our shipboard
duties. As the days dragged by, we assigned one
watch for the long nights, and another for the daylight
hours. I am sure that if these men had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
watched, they would have been observed dozing at
their posts, for none of us expected anything unusual
to happen, and by this time moved in that aimless
lethargy of men without aim or purpose.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of what I presumed to be
the 42nd day of our drifting, that a frenzied shout
from the night watch jolted us from our bunks. Land
had been sighted, and all hands, laughing and shouting
like men freed from long imprisonment, sprang to
work, long neglected, to reach this land. But each time
we came close enough to use the small landing boats,
the land seemed to move away from us, until at last
we found that the land sighted was a cluster of many
sized and shaped floating islands, the largest of which
became our goal. These islands moved on the conflicting
currents, and seemed forever out of our reach. Finally,
at the close of four days of chasing the island,
we were caught up on a current that crossed with that
of the largest, and it was there, on a strange, disjointed
piece of land, on a strange, cut-off sea, that we
found what seemed to all of us to be our dream of
Paradise.</p>

<p>The island was verdantly green, overflowing with
exotic flowers, and huge graceful trees which bore
sweet succulent fruit. A heavy, jasmine-sweet scent
was in the gentle winds. Here was a land of such
incredible beauty and serenity that I knew somehow
no men had ever been there before. Small, spring-fed
streams veined over the island, and the water from
these streams was like the coolest nectar. The days
were always full of sunshine, and the sky a shimmering
blue, but for all that sun, the days were never more
than comfortably warm. The island nights were
nights of incredible beauty. The waters shone with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
thousand, a million diamonds of phosphorus, the
night air was cool and sweet, and the stars above
seemed close enough to pluck from the sky. Day and
night, the peace and serenity none of us had ever
experienced before was over all, and I yearn for that
serenity to this day. There is always, I believe now,
that feeling over those wonders of Nature untouched
by Man.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because they had lived so long in
strangeness and uncertainty that they had become apathetic,
or perhaps it was because they had found on
this island Paradise the very essence of their hidden
dream of peace and beauty—whatever the reason, the
men who had been my companions and shipmates all
through these amazing happenings, now seemed content
to loll beneath the palm trees, swim in the clear,
warm water, or fish from the canoes which they had
fashioned. I heard no mention of returning to Cape
Cod, nor saw any desire nor yearning for familiar faces
and home land. We had established, in a small sheltered
cove at the south of the island where we had
first landed, our headquarters. Here we had everything
necessary for living. A small stream was close at hand,
the sea was at our doorstep, and the cove was abundant
with the coconut trees, the tropical fruit bushes,
and a plentiful amount of trees suitable for building
and firewood. My mates seemed perfectly content
to stay in this restricted area, and seemed to have no
desire to explore further the island upon which we
had landed. But, although I too felt that serenity,
happiness, and contentment, I yearned to explore the
rest of the island, for I felt that there were other mysteries
and wonders yet to be seen.</p>

<p>The rest of the island, which I set out to explore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
on the sixth day of our stay, was much like the small
part in which we had encamped, but seemed to grow
increasingly more beautiful as I travelled inland. All
through the morning, I tramped through the thick
growth of the island, coming now and then upon small
glades, where damp, fresh green moss surrounded little
pools and silvery streams. These glades were dark and
cool, and the air was pure and refreshing.</p>

<p>As I neared what I judged to be the centermost part
of the island, I broke through a wall of the island
greenery, and saw, like a blazing jewel in a setting of
green, a lake, its waters of glowing, deep blue. This
lake was surrounded by long-leaved trees, like the
weeping willow I had seen at home, that trailed to the
thick carpet of rich green moss below. Curling vine
tendrils, dashed here and there with dots of red berries
and exotic flowers, locked themselves around the giant
cypress trees. The sun pointed shafts of dull gold
through the trees that clasped their hands overhead,
and the air was alive, vital, and refreshingly cool, a
direct contrast to the pleasant, but heavy, sensuously
sweet smell of the rest of the island.</p>

<p>The cool, secluded lakeside oasis was a perfect place
to stop from my exploring, so I settled down on a soft
knoll of moss, ate fruit from nearby trees, and drank
the sweet coconut milk. I must have fallen into a deep
and restful sleep, for I suddenly started up, arrested
by sounds which I first attributed to dreams. The
silence and serenity was still in the air, but there came
to my ears, attuned by the deep silence to any small
sound, a strange, melodic humming. I was aware
through some instinct that I must not move. As I
strained my ears, the humming became louder, and
looking over the lake, I saw its smooth surface ripple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
as if a child had thrown a handful of pebbles onto
it. The humming vibrations seemed to have their
source directly in the lake.</p>

<p>I could sit still no longer, and crept slowly to the
water’s edge. The ripples grew larger, and to my
amazed eyes there appeared a hundred or so small
fish, whose brilliantly colored bodies shimmered and
vibrated. These fish were singing! The humming grew
in intensity, and I was able to recognize several of the
melodies; Scottish airs, South African chants, Southern
Negro songs, Cape Cod sea chanties, Lullabies—all
these came to my ear on a wave of the most beautiful
harmony I have ever heard. My brain reeled with
the phenomena and the beauty of the music. I could
not believe what my own ears and eyes told me, and
made a sudden movement toward the water. The
humming ceased instantly, the fish vanished, and the
water’s surface was as smooth as before. The great
silence once more filled the atmosphere. I felt a
strange exultation as I made my way back to the camp,
and though I said nothing of this amazing discovery
to my companions, I determined to return to the lake
of the humming fish the next day.</p>

<p>Day after day I returned to the green, cool loveliness
surrounding the lake of the humming fish. And each
day I awoke wondering what I could find there. At
times the fish would seem to greet me with their burst
of humming, but upon other occasions they never appeared.
It was on those days of silence that I began
to think that I was fast approaching insanity. As the
days passed, I became more hypnotized by the phenomena
of these humming fish. Gradually they
seemed to become accustomed to my presence, and
two of the boldest allowed me to feed them small bits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
of berry and weed that I tossed to them. Several times
these two came to the surface alone, and refused to
hum until I had given them the food. I began to
think of these two fish, which were bright silver in
color, with gorgeous stripes of deepest blue, green, and
yellow, as my own.</p>

<p>My strange rendezvous with the humming fish continued
for several weeks, and when my mates at last
came from their dream-world and began thinking of
home and family, I determined to capture the two fish
and carry them home with me. At length our ship,
which we had all considered wrecked beyond repair,
was mended enough to warrant an attempt to leave
the island and the sea of currents.</p>

<p>On my last journey to the lake of the humming fish,
which I had come to consider as my own piece of paradise
and contentment, I lured the small humming
fish into a wide-mouthed jug, filled with water from
their own lake. I supplied myself also with three kegs
of this same lake water, and prepared to carry the fish
home with me.</p>

<p>I will not dwell on the voyage home, it suffices to
say that we all arrived safely, and pledged ourselves to
secrecy about the island and the sea we had visited.
At home harbor, each man went his separate way, and
I, with my humming fish, strode home through the
darkness, taking the shortcut around Monomoy Point.
The night was dark as ink, and I stumbled from weariness,
dropping the precious keg of fish on the rocks at
the water’s edge, and the two humming fish escaped.
It seemed at that moment that all I had experienced
was a dream, for in the vanishing of the fish, only the
memory of my island paradise could remain.</p>

<p>For days I walked to the spot at Monomoy Point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
where the fish had escaped. I called to them as I had
at the island lake, and left small bits of their favorite
berry food at the water’s edge, but they could not, or
would not, appear.</p>

<p>You are perhaps wondering why I kept silent so
long. I had a wife and three children, and I was a man
of good name in my Cape Cod community, and could
not risk their well being by the revelation of this incident,
which would surely mark me as touched. And
further, I did not wish to have this most wonderful of
experiences tarnished and bandied about by unimaginative
and callous cynics.</p>

<p>It has been many years since I have gone to Monomoy
Point in an attempt to call back the humming
fish from that loveliest lake on the island paradise, but
I have never forgotten them or the place in which I
first found them. All my recollections are as vivid and
as real as the day when I first found myself in that
strange and beautiful setting.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
